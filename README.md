# Power BI Dashboard for Global Manufacturing Company ðŸš´

## Project Overview
This project is a business intelligence assignment where I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard for a global manufacturing company specializing in cycling equipment and accessories. The dashboard helps management track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, profits, revenue, and return rates.

## Project Goals
The main objectives of the project were to:
- Compare regional performance.
- Analyze product-level trends.
- Identify high-value customers.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Power BI**: Used for data connection, transformation, and visualization.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated columns and measures.
- **Data Modeling**: Built relational data models to integrate raw data.

## Dashboard Pages and Key Insights
The dashboard consists of four pages, each catering to specific analytical needs:

1. ### **Executive Overview**
   - Summarizes KPIs with:
     - $24.9 million in revenue
     - 25,200 orders
     - 2.2% return rate
   - Matrix display of the top 10 products by orders, revenue, and return rate.

2. ### **Geographical Data**
   - Provides regional insights with the ability to filter by year and region.

3. ### **Product Analysis**
   - Analyzes product trends with accessories leading in order volume, followed by bikes and clothing.

4. ### **Customer Insights**
   - Focuses on identifying and analyzing high-value customers for targeted strategies.
